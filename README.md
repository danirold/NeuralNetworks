# NeuralNetworks

Wine quality prediction using neural networks. Developed and optimized a Neural Network for wine quality prediction, achieving an 82% F1 score. The deep learning model demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline K-NN models. Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

This project was developed in collaboration with Sergio Martínez Olivera (https://github.com/sergiio8) as part of the Artificial Intelligence II course in the Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).
